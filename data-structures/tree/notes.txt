- hierarchical data structure
- file systems are trees
- bst provides moderate search (slower than array, faster than linked list)
- moderate insertion/deletion (slower than unordered linked list and faster than array)
- dynamic, nodes are linked through pointers

Applications:
1. Manipulate hierarchical data
2. Make information easy to search
3. Manipulate sorted lists of data. 
4. As a workflow for compositing digital images for visual effects. 
5. Router algorithms 
6. Form of a multi-stage decision-making (see business chess). 

Binary tree has at most 2 children per node
Top most node is called the root node

Data structure:
- Data
- Left pointer
- Right Pointer


Properties:
- Maximum number of nodes at level x = 2^x
- The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height h: 2^(h+1) -1
    - height of root is considered 0
    - Number of nodes 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + ... + 2^h => 2^h - 1 (Geometric series)
- In a binary tree with N nodes, the minimum number of levels is Log2(N+1)
- Binary Tree with L leaves has at least | Log2L? |+ 1 levels 
- In Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children, the number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.
